# School_District_Analysis
School District Analysis for my friend Maria using Python and Jupyter Notebook

##Overview of the school district analysis:
The purpose of my analysis was to find the overall passing percentages of students and determine if there was any correlation with the schools budget per student. Our analysis found that some test scores from the 9th grade at Thomas High were missing. 

#How is the district summary affected?
As you can see from the images below when we took out the the grades from Thomas High there was almost no affect on the overall district summary

#Summary
Overall after correcting math and reading data from Thomas High we did not see major changes in the distric's metrics. The biggest affect was on Thomas High's own scores which is not to shocking of a discovery.
